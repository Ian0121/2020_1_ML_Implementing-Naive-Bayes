# Notice

This is a project that implements a model to classify emails as spam or not spam. The project was developed as part of the "Machine Learning" course in the spring semester of 2020. Due to the sensitivity of the data, the TRAIN.csv and TEST.csv files cannot be shared publicly. If you are interested in accessing these files, please contact me via email. Once I receive permission from the professor, I will provide you with the necessary files. Thank you.
